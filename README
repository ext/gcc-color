gcc-color

Filter gcc output for warnings and errors and colors accordingly.

Install instructions
* Get the full name of your compiler
  Eg. i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++ etc.
* Somewhere in your path create symlinks to gcc-compiler-color.py named after
  the full name but with -color appended.
  Eg. i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc-color, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++-color
* If you intend to use this when compiling autotools projects etc you export CC
  and CXX set to the previously added "compilers".

gcc-compiler-color.py calls the compiler bases on the name of the symlink.
Eg. x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++-color call x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++

If you would like to disable colors for a single session just export NOCOLOR set to yes.
